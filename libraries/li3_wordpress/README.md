# li3_wordpress

A Lithium project to add Wordpress content to your Li3 App
* * *

This is not a plugin to add Lithium's library to Wordpress (Why would you want to do that!). Instead this grabs many of Wordpress' features and makes them available to your Lithium app.

So far it features the following.

 * Wordpress pages
 * Wordpress menu
 * Blog post index page
 * Blog post detail pages
 * Comments helper
 * Comment form helper
 * Categories helper
 * Archived posts helper
 * Routes which will handle the default settings
 * Over-rideable views so that you can customize your own layout even further

This project is still under development and is likely to be ready as a release in the next couple of weeks. At which time I will provide complete instructions of how to use this.
