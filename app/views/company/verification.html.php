<p><?=$t("Though IBWT is not regulated by HMRC, FCA and KYC/AML/MSB standards, we still require a certain level of verification and identity checks. This helps us prevent fraud, keep customers accounts secure and ensure best business practices.")?></p>

<p><?=$t("To become IBWT customer and use our platform and services you only need to register with an email.")?><br>
<?=$t("Acknowledging that a large portion of the world has no bank access, we have developed alternative means of funding. Currently deposit/withdrawal by mail is only available within the United Kingdom, via ")?><a href="http://www.royalmail.com/personal/uk-delivery/special-delivery" target="_blank">Royal Mail Special Delivery Service</a>.</p>
<p>The unbanked and those without a physical address are excluded from the financial system. But most of these individuals have access to a mobile phone, and emails.</p>
<p>To deposit via Royal Mail you only need a registered account, please be aware that there are limits for fiat deposits. Please see our <a href="/company/riskmanagement">Risk Management</a> page for more information.</p>
<p>To withdraw via Royal Mail you need to provide a withdrawal address.</p>
<p>IBWT will be adding physical IBWT locations and ATMs as a future development to enable customers to eliminate the withdrawal address barrier. Personal identification would still be required.</p>
<p>You can become an IBWT customer of 3 different tiers, having provided the relevant verified information. Each tier offers the services of the lower tiers and increased services.</p>
<p><strong>Please see our <a href="/company/riskmanagement">Risk Management</a> page for details on deposit and withdrawal criteria and limits.</strong></p>
<p>IBWT reserve the right to seek more information to verify a customer's identity, and/or to refuse an account if the customer's identity is not verified to our requirement.</p>
